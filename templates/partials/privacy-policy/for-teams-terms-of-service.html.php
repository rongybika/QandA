Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for an account are deemed part of this Agreement. Any such fees and payment obligations must be maintained throughout the Subscription Term for Company’s use of the Product, and valid payment information must be maintained at all times during the Subscription Term in order for Company account to remain active. Fees will be stated upon checkout. Company hereby authorizes WebSite to charge Company all fees stated at checkout and take payment in accordance with the payment information in your account. All amounts paid are non-refundable. In the event of an increase or decrease in your payment obligation, the fees payable by you will increase or decrease in accordance with such modification.</p>

By choosing to use the Product and/or Services, you agree to pay WebSite, including through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any such use in accordance with the applicable payment terms. You hereby authorize us, directly or through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”).

WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM COMPANY, UNLESS COMPANY PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) TO i) CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION OR RECURRING PAYMENTS OR ii) CHANGE THE PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES MADE PRIOR TO WebSite CONFIRMATION OF AN AFOREMENTIONED NOTICE. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE THE PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO YOUR SETTINGS PAGE. Company’s continued use of the Product and/or Services reaffirms that we are authorized to charge the payment method provided, and that we may submit those charges for payment and Company will be responsible for such charges.

Charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially registered to use the Product and/or Services.</p>
        <p class="fs-body2 lh-lg fc-medium">Until notice of non-renewal is provided, any subscription for Services or access to the Product will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the Subscription Term originally selected, and will be charged at the current non-promotional rate as of the renewal date.
